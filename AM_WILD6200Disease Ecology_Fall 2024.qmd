Quarto is a powerful tool creating dynamic documents that combine text, code, and data visualizations. For your assignments and worksheets, using Quarto will allow you to seamlessly integrate your analysis with your written explanations/comments, making your reports more cohesive and professional.

## Intergrating code and text

Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")

```

## Host, Pathogen and Environment Interaction

Disease, the formation and progression are greatly influenced by the dynamic interplay between host, pathogen and environment. Immune function, genetic factors, and health conditions each affect the hosts vulnerability to infection. Bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites are examples of pathogens. They have unique ways of invading and taking advantages of their hosts, and frequently adapt to avoid immune responses. Pathogen survival, transmission, and host exposure can be impacted by the environment. For instance, environmental factors like humidity and temperature can impact the growth of pathogen and the frequency of vector-borne diseases.
